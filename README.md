# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my synced LeetCode problem solutions,
maintained for consistency, learning, and interview preparation.
All solutions are written with clarity, optimized approaches, and clean
coding practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal archive of the problems I solve on LeetCode.
It includes detailed, well-structured solutions across various problem statements.
The goal is to maintain a long-term record of my coding journey and improve problemâ€‘solving skills through revision and analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose of This Repository

-   To document all LeetCode problems I solve
-   To maintain a clean and organized solution history
-   To revise patterns, data structures, and algorithms
-   To use as a reference during coding interviews
-   To track my growth over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You Will Find Here

-   Clean, readable, and maintainable code
-   Solutions in multiple programming languages
-   Optimized approaches where applicable
-   Comments explaining logic (when needed)
-   Continuous additions as I solve more problems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics will be covering 

The solutions cover a wide range of data structure and algorithm
concepts, including:

-   Arrays
-   Strings
-   HashMaps and Sets
-   Linked Lists
-   Stacks and Queues
-   Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
-   Graphs
-   Sliding Window
-   Two Pointers
-   Binary Search
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Recursion and Backtracking
-   Heaps and Priority Queues
-   Greedy Algorithms

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Languages Used

Depending on the problem and requirement, I solve using:

-   Java
-   C
